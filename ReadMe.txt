C-Ranker is a post-database searching software for peptide identification. The software package implements solvers for both C-Ranker model and cost-sensitive Ranker (CS-Ranker) model. The goal of the package is to identify correct PSMs output from the database searching SEQUEST. Users can find that it is easily to employ C-Ranker to identify reliable PSMs from other database searching engines, such as MASCOT, and X!TANDEM. It is developed mainly in Matlab and naturally supports Matlab platform.
